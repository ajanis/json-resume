  summary: >-
    My career path began with Obsidian Hosting, a company I started to provide
    	 simple deployment of multiplayer game servers, which I bundled with voice chat and a variety of webhosting services.
    	 As this grew, I started to focus more on systems administration, reliability, scalability, monitoring, and automation.
    	 A local web hosting company job opening caught my attention because it would allow me to access resources I did not have otherwise, and learn from more experienced engineers.
    	 I moved to Colorado in 2010 to further my professional interests in large-scale infrastructure and personal interests in snow and whitewater.
