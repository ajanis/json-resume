  summary: >-
    I think more people should build a private cloud with distributed & tiered storage, learn the tools to deploy it and collect the data to see into it.  At home.  For fun.*
      I do this just to support everyday home automation and entertainment.
      My career path began with Obsidian Hosting, a company I started to provide simple deployment of multiplayer game servers, which I bundled with voice chat and a variety of web hosting services. As I grew that infrastructure on a budget, I came to appreciate the open-source community. I repurposed old hardware for my home network and started looking for reasons to integrate any project that grabbed my attention.  Not long after, I took a position with a local web hosting company for the opportunity to learn from an experienced team in a large-scale, high-uptime environment.
      In 2010, a senior role with Yahoo brought me to Colorado, where the thriving dev community has continued to shape my personal and professional relationships.
      In addition to the snow, rivers, and mountains, 'building cool things' remains at the top of my passions.

        Support initiative to modernize/automate CDN Environments
      - >-
        As part of the CDN (Akamai) Team, I was tasked with creating scripts and workflows to assist our team in supporting our internal customer needs.
      - >-
        Worked alongside our principal architect during early planning stages to codify CDN configuration and bring existing and future environments into sync and under revision control.
      - >-
        Rebuilt a suite of utilities used by dev/ops teams across the business to shape and validate web traffic across development and production environments.
      - >-
        Built new CDN purge utilities as part of a mentoring project with a student intern.  Over a series of paired working calls, we created and packaged a CLI tool and an associated AWS Lambda function that can be easily used by individuals or as part of automation processes.  While this was a relatively simple script, we discussed and implemented common and recommended tools for revision control (Git), dependency management (Pyenv, Poetry),  package management (PyPI/Homebrew), and process automation (Ansible).  The student presented the project to our team's management chain as a successful goal for the internship.

    highlights:
      - >-
        Worked on-site with a very high-value client who wished to validate OpenStack reliability on an upcoming generation of hardware and rethink their internal cloud design. Together we developed tools to automate containerized deployment (pre- docker-openstack) and I guided the team in testing, deploying, managing, and monitoring their OpenStack cloud. My unique, intuitive and maintainable design prompted immediate praise from the client, for which I earned WWT's global service provider engineer of the year award.
      - >-
        Developed an automated build pipeline using Ansible Tower and Foreman, which, given minimal specifications, allows our technicians to deploy the resources necessary to provision and test hundreds of systems each day; which are shipped to our customers fully racked and cabled for immediate integration.
      - >-
        Created an environment for testing and metrics collection for a prototype mesh storage solution. This utilized nVME drives and remote direct disk access (over ethernet) to provide ultra-low latency with ultra-high i/o operations.

      - >-
        Headed a storage initiative to compare flash-based PureStorage against NetApp's latest flash-based storage as the backend for our newly virtualized databases. Technologies used in this project allowed me to learn about fiber-channel switching/zoning configuration on Cisco UCS 6200 Fabric-Interconnects, Linux FCoE, and multipathing, as well as configuring the KVM virtual machines to boot from SAN.
