              <li>Support initiative to modernize/automate CDN Environments</li>
              <li>As part of the CDN (Akamai) Team, I was tasked with creating scripts and workflows to
                assist our team in supporting our internal customer needs.</li>
              <li>Worked alongside our principal architect during early planning stages to codify CDN
                configuration and bring existing and future environments into sync and under revision
                control.</li>
              <li>Rebuilt a suite of utilities used by dev/ops teams across the business to shape and
                validate web traffic across development and production environments.</li>
              <li>Built new CDN purge utilities as part of a mentoring project with a student intern. Over
                a series of paired working calls, we created and packaged a CLI tool and an associated
                AWS Lambda function that can be easily used by individuals or as part of automation
                processes. While this was a relatively simple script, we discussed and implemented
                common and recommended tools for revision control (Git), dependency management (Pyenv,
                Poetry), package management (PyPI/Homebrew), and process automation (Ansible). The
                student presented the project to our team&#x27;s management chain as a successful goal
                for the internship.</li>

              <li>Worked on-site with a very high-value client who wished to validate OpenStack
                reliability on an upcoming generation of hardware and rethink their internal cloud
                design. Together we developed tools to automate containerized deployment (pre-
                docker-openstack) and I guided the team in testing, deploying, managing, and monitoring
                their OpenStack cloud. My unique, intuitive and maintainable design prompted immediate
                praise from the client, for which I earned WWT&#x27;s global service provider engineer
                of the year award.</li>
              <li>Developed an automated build pipeline using Ansible Tower and Foreman, which, given
                minimal specifications, allows our technicians to deploy the resources necessary to
                provision and test hundreds of systems each day; which are shipped to our customers
                fully racked and cabled for immediate integration.</li>
              <li>Created an environment for testing and metrics collection for a prototype mesh storage
                solution. This utilized nVME drives and remote direct disk access (over ethernet) to
                provide ultra-low latency with ultra-high i/o operations.</li>
              <li>Worked with the Principle Ceph Storage Engineer to better understand the management,
                deployment, and performance tuning of Ceph clusters.</li>
              <li>Consulted the first cross-divisional project team in building an automated solution to
                verify and remediate the hardware configuration, health status, firmware, and operating
                system version. Provided guidance related to setting up a PXE boot environment for
                hardware and system configuration, automated firmware remediation, and reporting.</li>
